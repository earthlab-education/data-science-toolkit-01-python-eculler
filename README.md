# Data Science Toolkit - Day 1, Python Fundamentals

Welcome to Data Science Toolkit! Today, you'll learn:

  1. How to run Python code for free in Google Colaboratory (Colab)
  2. Variable and data types in Python
  3. Importing and plotting data
  4. Functions and loops
  
To get started, open up the data-science-toolkit-python.ipynb Jupyter notebook in Colab. There's a link at the top of the notebook that will take you straight to Colab!

When you're done for the day, you can save your work back here by going to File > Save a copy in GitHub in Colab. **NOTE:** Google Colab will change the dashes (-) in the file name to underscores (_) by default, and then GitHub will recognize your work as a different file. **Make sure to change the underscores back to dashes when you save!**
